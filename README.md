shinyMILC: A Graphical User Interface to MILC
---------------------------------------------

A very basic and experimental user interface to the MILC package by Stavroula
Chrysanthopoulou. **Not usable for anything at the current stage.**

Install from Github:

```
devtools::install_github("christophsax/shinyMILC")
```

and run the App:

```
library(shinyMILC)
shinyMILC()
```
